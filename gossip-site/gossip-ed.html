<blockquote>

<p>
The module <samp>gossip-ed</samp> will provide a program to construct
simple hierarchical blocks in an interactive, graphical way.  It will
also have features to start and control simulations.

<h3><a name=Overview>Overview</a></h3>

<p>
The goal of <samp>gossip-ed</samp> is primarily to make it easier to
get started with GOSSIP and to provide convenience when doing simple
things.  It is not meant to replace the more powerful textual
descriptions that <samp>gossip-sim</samp> reads.  However, it should
integrate well with these textual programs so that it is possible to
combine both methods easily in one simulation.

One important function of <samp>gossip-ed</samp> will of course be to
have something catchy to show to the people.

<p>
There is no detailed design for <samp>gossip-ed</samp> right now, but
we have a more or less solid foundation so that the rest of
<samp>gossip-ed</samp> can be written mostly in Scheme.

<h3><a name=MockupTutorial>Mockup and Tutorial</h3>

<p>
We currently have a mockup of a schematic entry tool that is quite
useable.  Please follow the <a
href=docs/mockup-tutorial.html>tutorial</a> (with screenshots!) to
find out how to use it.
