<h1>History</h1>
</center>

<blockquote>

<p>
Although it is in one way brand new, GOSSIP already has quite a
history.  There probably isn't any code left from previous
incarnations, but a lot of the early design decisions still influence
the current implementation.

<p>
In its former life, GOSSIP wasn't called GOSSIP, of course.  It was
called <tt>sim</tt>.  It was started while I (Marius) was working as a
student at the <a
href=http://www-kt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de/indexe.html>Institute for
Communication Technology</a>.  The initiator was Thorsten Herfet and
the project was further nurtured by Thorsten Tödtmann.  Thorsten
T. wrote lots of code and made lots of poor students use the tool.
There is still a <a
href=http://www-kt.e-technik.uni-dortmund.de/m_tm/sim.html>web
page</a> about the old <tt>sim</tt>.  I don't know if they are still
using it.

<p>
The journey from nothing to <tt>sim</tt> and from <tt>sim</tt> to
GOSSIP was roughly like this: Naturally, the institute was doing
simulations of their communications systems, and they wanted to have a
tool to facilitate this.  The tool should allow the composition of
independently developed programs, and allow only strictly controlled
communication between these components.  Restricting the communication
was desired so that one could be fairly sure that no information
reached a component that wouldn't reach it in the real system.  The
components should run in separate processes, so that it was easy to
point fingers when one component caused a crash.  Of course,
components were written in C or C++, and even ever so small bugs in
these languages cause a program to fall over in obscure and
unintelligible ways, so having a simulation crash due to a faulty
component happened quite often.

<p>
The original <tt>sim</tt> thus consisted of a C++ API that people were
supposed to write their components against.  This API was implemented
by a library and each component was compiled into a separate
executable.  There was a control program that could interpret a
simple description language.  This control program would start all
needed programs and connect them via Unix pipes.  Communication
between the components would happen over these pipes.

<p>
Of course, performance sucked big time and the description language
quickly became inadequate because it didn't have any `advanced'
features like arithmetic expressions or loops.

<p>
My recollection is hazy about what happened next in what sequence, but
<tt>sim</tt> moved from putting components into processes to linking
them as shared libraries (without changing the API significantly!),
and we made it use TCL as the description language instead of our home
grown one.

<p>
Around that time, RMS launched the <i>"Why you should not use TCL"</i>
debate, and indeed, we have found that it was quite easy to reach
TCL's limitations.  I tried to write a static scheduler in TCL to
speed up the execution of typical simulations, but I nearly lost all
my hair over this.  So, in a fit of <i>Do the Right Thing</i>, I
decided to replace TCL with the Scheme implementation <a
href=http://www.gnu.org/software/guile>Guile</a>.  I have not
regretted it since.  Almost all of the control program is now written
in Scheme, including a static scheduler, and the description language
is Scheme, too.

<p>
Like it is in a University setting, people moved on to other tasks,
and maintainance of <tt>sim</tt> languished.  However, recently, I had
to use a certain <a
href=http://www.synopsys.com/products/dsp/dsp.html>proprietary stream
driven simulator</a>, and it annoyed me greatly.  I thought I could do
better than that, because in some senses <tt>sim</tt> already was
better.

<p>
I decided to return to <tt>sim</tt> and make it into a usable piece
of software that is superior to proprietary tools simply by being <a
href=http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html>Free Software</a>.

<p>
The old <tt>sim</tt> lacked some important features, like feedback
loops, delays, a clean way to manage libraries of components, and a
good name.  So I decided to redo most of <tt>sim</tt> incrementally,
and published the result on Sourceforge as the GOSSIP project.  I hope
that enough people will find it useful to keep it alive.
