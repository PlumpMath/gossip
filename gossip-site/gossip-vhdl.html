<blockquote>

<p>
There is not much to say about VHDL support in GOSSIP right now.  One
possibility is to translate from a subset of VHDL to the native input
language of <samp>gossip-sim</samp>.  The subset will be chosen to
support the simulation model of <samp>gossip-sim</samp>, synchronous
data flow.  Behavioural code will be translated into C++, using a
modified version of the <a
href=http://www.freehdl.seul.org>FreeHDL</a> code generator, and
structural code will be translated into hierarchical blocks written in
Scheme.

<p>
Another possibility would be to interface <samp>gossip-sim</samp> with
the FreeHDL simulator.  This might be easier and provide more
features.  However, you would not have a fast synchronous simulator
for a synchronous subset of VHDL.
