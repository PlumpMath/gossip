<p>
There are a number of ways to install the packages that make up the
GOSSIP Simulation Environment.  The easiest is to install GOSSIP from
pre-build binary packages.  The most customizable is to download the
source code of each package and compile it yourself.

<p>
We recommend that you install GOSSIP from pre-build binary packages,
if you can.  Right now, we only have packages for RedHat Linux on
i386.  If you know how to build packages for other operating systems,
and would like to package GOSSIP for them, please <a
href=https://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=4049>contact</a> us.

<li><a href=#source>Installation from Source</a></li>
<li><a href=#rpmbuild>Build your own RPM Packages</a></li>
</ul>

<h2><a name="redhat">Installation on RedHat Linux</a></h2>

<p>
There are RPMs available in the <a
href=ftp://gossip.sourceforge.net/pub/gossip>ftp-space</a> for recent
versions of RedHat Linux.  In particular, there are
<ul>
<li><a href=ftp://gossip.sourceforge.net/pub/gossip/gossip-sim-0.8.2-1.i386.rpm>
gossip-sim-0.8.2-1.i386.rpm</a>
<li><a href=ftp://gossip.sourceforge.net/pub/gossip/gossip-ed-0.5.0-1.i386.rpm>
gossip-ed-0.5.0-1.i386.rpm</a>
</ul>
The packages above were tested with Helixcode's Gnome packages
on Redhat 6.2 (Zoot).  To install one of these packages,
run <tt>rpm</tt> like this

<blockquote><tt> # rpm -U gossip-sim-0.8.2-1.i386.rpm
</tt></blockquote>

You need to be <tt>root</tt> to do this.  The packages contain
dependency information so that you will learn what other packages you
need to install when trying to install one of the GOSSIP packages.

<p>Some packages that you might need are
<ul>
<li><a href=http://www.redhat.com/swr/i386/guile-1.4-2.i386.html>guile-1.4-2</a>
<li><a href=http://www.redhat.com/swr/i386/guile-devel-1.4-2.i386.html>guile-devel-1.4-2</a>
<li><a href=http://www.redhat.com/swr/i386/guile-oops-0.9.0-1.i386.html>guile-oops-0.9.0-1</a>
<li><a href=http://www.redhat.com/swr/i386/guile-oops-devel-0.9.0-1.i386.html>guile-oops-devel-0.9.0-1</a>
<li><a href=http://www.ping.de/sites/zagadka/guile-gtk/latest.html>guile-gtk-0.19-1</a>
</ul>

To uninstall a package with <tt>rpm</tt>, do something like this
<blockquote><tt>
# rpm -e gossip-sim
</tt></blockquote>

<h2><a name="source">Installation from Source</a></h2>

<p>
The source packages of GOSSIP follow the <a
href=http://www.gnu.org/prep/standards_44.html>GNU standard</a> for
configuration, which is probably familiar to you already.  In general,
the packages themselves contain the most detailed and most upto date
instructions on how they would like to be installed in a file called
<tt>INSTALL</tt>, and you are expected to read them.  Here we give you
only a quick overview of a normal installation and point you to places
where external packages might be gotten from.

<p>
Especially when you install packages in some other location than
<tt>/usr/local/</tt>, things are probably not so easy as they are
portrayed here.

<ol>
<li>Make sure you have the pakages that Gossip depends on.

  <p>
  For <tt>gossip-sim</tt>, you need
  <a href=ftp://www.gnu.org/pub/gnu/guile/guile-1.4.tar.gz>
  <tt>guile-1.4</tt></a> and
  <a href=ftp://www.gnu.org/pub/gnu/guile/guile-oops-0.9.0.tar.gz>
  <tt>guile-oops-0.9.0</tt></a>.

  <p>
  For <tt>gossip-ed</tt>, you need <tt>gossip-sim</tt> and <a
  href=http://www.gtk.org>Gtk+</a> and <a
  href=http://www.ping.de.sites/zagadka/guile-gtk>guile-gtk</a>,
  preferably in their latest versions.

  <p>
  The various GOSSIP library packages might require additional
  software to be installed on your system.  Please refer to the
  packages in question.

<p>
<li>Download the sources of <a
href=http://download.sourceforge.net/gossip/gossip-sim-0.8.2.tar.gz>
<tt>gossip-sim</tt></a> and <a
href=http://download.sourceforge.net/gossip/gossip-ed-0.5.0.tar.gz>
<tt>gossip-ed</tt></a> from the <a
href=http://sourceforge.net/project/filelist.php?group_id=4049>File
Release</a> area.

<p>
<li>Unpack them in some suitable directory.  The tarballs create a new
directory that will be filled, so you don't need to worry that files
will spill all over your current directory.

<blockquote><tt>
$ tar xzf gossip-sim-0.8.2.tar.gz<br>
$ cd gossip-sim-0.8.2
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
<li>Configure the sources for your system.
<blockquote><tt>
$ ./configure
</tt></blockquote>

Run <tt>./configure --help</tt> to learn about the options hat you can
pass to </tt>configure</tt>.

<p>
<li>Compile the sources into the final executables.
<blockquote><tt>
$ make
</tt></blockquote>

<p>
<li>Install the executables in the system.
<blockquote><tt>
# make install
</tt></blockquote>

You probably need to be <tt>root</tt> for this step.

<p>
<li>Repeat for the rest of the packages, like <tt>gossip-ed</tt> and
any block libraries.

</ol>

<h2>
<a name="rpmbuild"></a>Build your own RPM Packages</h2>

<h4>Get the .tar.gz files</h4>

You must download .tar.gz file even if you don't want to install the GOSSIP
from .tar.gz. The .spec files are used to build rpms and, more important,
the source code&nbsp; are keep in the .tar.gz files.
<br>After download,&nbsp; put the .tar.gz files into
<blockquote><tt>/usr/src/redhat/SOURCES</tt></blockquote>
Here I assume that you are using Redhat&nbsp; and you have&nbsp; NOT change
the configuration of the rpm. If you are using other packages like debain&nbsp;
or you are not sure, try the following to find&nbsp; RPM_SOURCE_DIR .
<blockquote><tt># rpm --showrc</tt></blockquote>
You may need to trace it down since, in most of the case,&nbsp; the value&nbsp;
depends on other macro definitions. If you are still not sure here, check
out the www.rpm.org for more information about how to use RPM.
<br>&nbsp;
<h4>
Get the .spec files</h4>
Either download the .spec files from download section above or open .tar.gz
file to get it.
<br>You can modify the .spec files for your own needs
<br>Put the .spec file where you want but remember the place.
<h4>
Make the rpm package</h4>
Switch to root first and go the place where you put the .spec files before.
<br>To build the gossip-sim
<blockquote><tt># rpm -ba gossip-sim-0.8.spec</tt></blockquote>
To build the gossip-ed
<blockquote><tt># rpm -ba gossip-ed-0.0.spec</tt></blockquote>
If it is ok, you can pick up the rpm files for your platform somewhere
below /usr/src/redhat/RPMS depending your platform( again assuming&nbsp;
the Redhat).
