<p>
The module <samp>gossip-sim</samp> is the core member of the GOSSIP
environment.  It is the engine that carries out the simulations, given
Scheme programs as input.

<h3><a name="Overview">Overview</h3>

<p>
Simulations are described as <em>nets</em> of <em>components</em>.
The components are connected via <em>signals</em>.  A component has
<em>ports</em> that can accept the signals.  While executing the
simulation, a component receives data at its input ports and produces
new data at its output ports (which in turn travels thru a signal to
the input port of another component).  A component must specify how
much data it expects at each of its input ports and how much it
produces at each output port once enough data has arrived.  These
sizes must remain constant during the whole simulation.  The
simulation engine takes care of scheduling all components in the right
order.

<p>
Components are created by <em>instantiating</em> <em>blocks</em>.  A
specific block is a blueprint of all components that perform the same
kind of function.  While instantiating a block you can specify values
for the <em>generics</em> of the block.  The generics are parameters
that influence the behaviour of the resulting components.  Each
component has its own, independent set of values for the generics of
its block.  Blocks can be organized into <em>libraries</em>, but they
don't have to be.

<p>
There are two general kinds of blocks, and correspondingly two general
kinds of components: <em>primitive</em> ones and
<em>hierarchical</em> ones.  A primitive component is one that
actually takes part in the final simulation.  It contains executable
code that gets run whenever enough data has arrived at its input ports
and there is room in its output buffer.  A hierarchical component on
the other hand contains code to instantiate sub-components inside
itself.  Ultimately, there will be a net of primitive components that
can be executed in concert.  Thus, primitive components will do the
real simulation work, while hierarchical components are a tool for
organizing the net of primitive components.

<p>
The data itself that is transported via the signals consists of just
bits, as far as the simulation engine is concerned.  It is up to the
primitive components to interpret these bits.  There is support for
checking that connected components will interpret these bits in the
same way, however.  There is also support for easily writing primitive
blocks that work with complex numbers, or integers of up to 32 bits.

<p>
Ports can be declared to be <em>multi ports</em>.  A multi port can
accept any number of signals that are then treated individually by the
component.  It is, for example, possible to implement a
<samp>sum</samp> block with a multi port as its sole input and a
normal port as its output.  When instantiated, the resulting component
would then query how much signals are actually connected to the input
and add them all up.

<p>
The simulation system is targeted at simulations that contain
relatively few components with relatively rich behaviour.  In a
typical use, you might have a couple of hundreds components that do
things like matrix multiplications or factorizations, implement radio
transmission channel models, adaptively filter a digital signal, or
something on that scale.  There might also be lesser components that
do multiplications or additions, but it wont probably be efficient to
simulate gate-level designs that consist of hundred thousands of
individual nand gates.

<p>
Gossip-sim itself is implemented in two coarse layers.  The upper
layer that is responsible for building the simulation net from user
input, checking its validity and finding a suitable schedule for the
primitive components, is written in Guile Scheme.  The lower layer
that is responsible for actually carrying out the simulation is
written in C++.

<p>
The consequence of this is that hierarchical blocks are written in
Scheme. The top-level user specification of the simulation net is
written in Scheme, too, as it can be seen as a special purpose
hierarchical block.  Primitive blocks are written in C++ and loaded
into the simulation as shared libraries.

<p>
When describing the layout of your simulation net, you are in effect
writing a Scheme program and consequently you can use all features of
Scheme.  This gives you a considerable flexible, much more than you
would get from more special purpose languages like VHDL, for example.
