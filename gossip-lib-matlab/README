Read INSTALL to find out how to configure this package.

This library contains a single block, "matlab", which can evaluate
arbitrary Matlab commands.  Complex numbers are gathered on the input
of the block and passed to the Matlab command in a matrix.  Likewise,
a result matrix is channeled to the output port of the block.

The included Makefile requires GNU make.


Implementation
--------------

This block uses a rather complicated implementation.  We can't use the
`engine' interface to Matlab, because the run-time requirements of
libeng are incompatible with those of Gossip blocks (libeng requires
libc5 while Gossip uses whatever is current on the platform).

Additonally, I couldn't quite figure out how to build libc5 binaries
on SuSE.

Therefore, we add our C code to Matlab in the form of a `mex' function
(I found a way to make this work).  We communicate with it thru a
named Unix pipe.  The mex function takes over control of Matlab and
uses it like an engine.

For startup, we create a temporary directory and place a suitable
"startup.m" file in it.  The name pipe will also be in this directory.
The mex function will change back to the original directory before
evaluating any commands.
