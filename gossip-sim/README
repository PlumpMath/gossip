This is gossip-sim, the synchronous data flow simulation engine of the
GOSSIP project.

Look into INSTALL for installation instructions.  After installation,
you should read the included manual and try out the examples.  Then at
least skim thru the reference part of the documentation.  That should
enable you to write your own simulations.

Right now, you should expect to write all of your simulation models
yourself as extensive libraries with ready-made blocks are not yet
available.

Contributing
------------

If you want to contribute to GOSSIP, here are some ideas:

   - Test drive it until it breaks and report the bugs.

   - Proof read the documentation and report any bad usage of English,
     typoraphical errors, inconsistencies, omissions, wierd
     explanations, etc.  New language to replace the bad parts is most
     appreciated.

   - Enhance the web presence of GOSSIP.

   - Think of user interface enhancements and contribute your ideas.

   - Hang out on the mailing list and help other users.

   - Write block programs and distribute them freely.

   - Start to collect block programs and release well maintained
     libraries of them.

   - Take on one of the other parts of GOSSIP, for example gossip-ed,
     the schematic capture tool.

   - Or simply spread the word (and the disk)!
