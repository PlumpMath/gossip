This package should behave like a regular GNUish `configure-make'
package.  When you know how to work with such a package, just go
ahead.  Else read on.

The simplest way to compile this package is:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the package's source code and type
     `./configure' to configure the package for your system.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.

By default, `make install' will install the package's files in
`/usr/local/libexec/gossip/sim' and `/usr/local/share/gossip/sim'.
You can specify an installation prefix other than `/usr/local' by
giving `configure' the option `--prefix=PATH'.

You can specify separate installation prefixes for
architecture-specific files and architecture-independent files.  If
you give `configure' the option `--exec-prefix=PATH', the package will
use PATH as the prefix for installing the shared libraries that
implement the primitive simulation blocks.  The Scheme source for
hierachical blocks will still use the regular prefix.
