README for gossip-ed version 0.5
--------------------------------

This is going to be the schematic editor of the Gossip simulation
environment.  The plan is to write most of it in Scheme, using a
customized version of the GnomeCanvas widget for the display.  We do
not use GnomeCavas directly because I don't want to have too many
dependencies on external, rapidly evolving packages.  We wont likely
be using the anti-aliased stuff from Raph, as cool as it is.  The
weight for this schematic editor is on fast, informative display that
works well over the wire, and not on the prettiest possible WYSIWIG.

For textual labels, I think we can settle for mock-zooming.  That is,
we have a font in a (small) number of different sizes, and we use the
size that works best at a certain zoom level.  When the text is too
small, it is greeked; when it gets too large, we simply use the
largest font.  This scheme might actually work better than trying to
do true zooming.  My favorite font would be lucidasans, which should
be available in sizes 8, 10, 12, 14, 18, 24 with every X11
installation.

The mockup is now useable.  Be sure to read the tutorial in doc/.


User customization
------------------

On startup, gossip-ed-mockup will load "~/.gossip/edrc" if it exists.
Some useful functions to call from this file:

 - add-button LABEL PROC

   Add a button with text LABEL to the GUI.  When it is clicked PROC
   is called (with no arguments).

 - save-to-file

   Saves the current schematic

 - save-to-file-ask

   Ask foir a filename, then saves.

 - load-from-file FILE

   Load schematic FILE into the editor.

 - run-testbench

   Start a simulation of the current schematic.

 - refresh-libraries

   Refresh the library display.


and many more.  Use the source, Luke

Example edrc file:

    (define (save-and-run)
      (save-to-file)
      (run-testbench))

    (add-button "Save & Run" save-and-run)
