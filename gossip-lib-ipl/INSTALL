The usual way to build a Gossip block library consists of these steps:

  1. `cd' to the directory containing the libraries's source code and type
     
	./configure --install=DIR

     to configure the package for your system.  DIR is the directory
     where you want the library to appear after installation.  The
     installation process will create a subdirectory of DIR with the
     name of the library and copy all blocks into that subdirectory.

     For example, when the library is called `misc' and contains a
     block named `foo', the directory `DIR/misc' will be created and
     the block will be copied to `DIR/misc/foo'.

     To use the new library, you must make sure that DIR is in the
     GOSSIP_SIM_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable.

     Using `--installdir' is recommended for a `per-user' installation
     on homogenous systems.  When you want to install a library
     system-wide or on a heterogenous network with multiple
     incompatible platforms, you might want to use `--prefix' and
     `--exec-prefix' instead.

     Running `configure' as

        ./configure --prefix=PREFIX --exec-prefix=EXEC_PREFIX

     will cause architecture independent blocks to be installed in
     `PREFIX/share/gossip/sim/<libname>/' and architecture-dependent
     blocks in `EXEC_PREFIX/libexec/gossip/sim/<libname>'.
     EXEC_PREFIX defaults to PREFIX.

     When `configure' is run with no options, it defaults to
     `--prefix=/usr/local'.

  2. Type `make' to compile the package.

  3. Type `make install' to install the programs and any data files and
     documentation.

  4. You can remove the program binaries and object files from the
     source code directory by typing `make clean'.  To also remove the
     files that `configure' created (so you can compile the package for
     a different kind of computer), type `make distclean'.
