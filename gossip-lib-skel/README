This is an example how you might organize the sources for a Gossip
library distribution.  It does not contain any interesting blocks
itself, but it has enough infrastructure to make writing and
installing blocks easy.

You should copy this directory and rename it to a more appropriate
name.  Modify the Makefile to reflect your library, according to the
instructions contained therein.  Then replace this README with a more
appropriate one for your library.

Read INSTALL to find out how to configure this package.

The included Makefile requires GNU make.
